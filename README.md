### Description: 

---

This is not a portfolio project.  

This is a reference sheet for my personal use.  

The genesis of this project is actually kind of silly. I had been going along book marking reading materials from the Google Data Analytics Certificate Course over the course of multiple days when I discovered that my browser hadn't saved a link. So I decided to make a resource for myself and others. It's essentially a reading list for beginning data analyst enthusiasts.  Credit for their original compilation goes to Google.  Not all links in the course have been included. Links to Google's proprietary templates, learning logs, and other pages which represented their original work have been excluded since the object of this is not to recreate (i.e. plagiarise) the work of Google. What has been included were links to homework readings to provide others a simple resource to refer to.
